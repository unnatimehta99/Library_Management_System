# Library-Management-System-SQL-based-Database-Design-and-Analysis

## Introduction
A library management system is crucial as it streamlines book tracking, enhances accessibility, and facilitates efficient resource management, ensuring an organized and user-friendly experience for both librarians and patrons.

## Database Design
The database design for the library management system includes tables such as `book_categories`, `branches`, `students`, `books`, `book_issue_log`, `authors`, `book_reviews`, and others, forming relationships between books, users, students, categories, branches, and related entities. This design enables effective tracking of book details, student information, book transactions, reviews, and other essential aspects within the library, ensuring efficient library management and organization.


The dataset consists of several tables that facilitate the management of a library system. Here's a summary of the tables and their purposes:

* book_categories: Stores various categories of books available in the library.
* branches: Contains information about different branches of the library.
* student_categories: Represents different categories of students or patrons, specifying the maximum number of books allowed to be issued.
* users: Stores user information, such as librarians, administrators, etc.
* students: Contains details of students, including their names, category, branch, email, etc. Tracks the number of books issued to students.
* books: Holds information about books, including titles, descriptions, category IDs, and details about who added the book and when.
* book_issue_log: Keeps a log of issued books, recording book IDs, student IDs, issue timestamps, return timestamps, and the user who issued the book.
* availability: Manages the availability status of books, indicating whether a book is available for issue or not.
* authors: Stores author details for books.
* book_authors: Represents a many-to-many relationship between books and authors.
* book_reviews: Contains reviews and ratings given by students for various books.
* book_publishers: Holds publisher details for books.
* book_publisher_relationship: Manages the relationship between books and publishers
